# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?

Understanding what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press Enter is a fundamental topic for software engineers. This blog post breaks down the process step-by-step, touching on key concepts such as DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancing, web servers, application servers, and databases.

## 1. **DNS Request**

The first step is translating the human-readable URL (https://www.google.com) into an IP address that computers can understand. This involves the following steps:

1. **Browser Cache:** Your browser checks its local cache to see if it already knows the IP address for `www.google.com`.
2. **Operating System Cache:** If the browser cache doesn’t have the record, it queries the operating system’s DNS cache.
3. **Recursive Resolver:** If the OS cache misses, the query is sent to a recursive DNS resolver provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a public service like Google Public DNS.
4. **Root, TLD, and Authoritative Name Servers:** The resolver queries the root DNS server, then the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (.com in this case), and finally the authoritative name server for Google to get the IP address.

Once the IP address is resolved, the browser knows where to send the request.

## 2. **TCP/IP**

The browser establishes a connection with the server hosting `www.google.com` using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over the Internet Protocol (IP). This process involves:

1. **Three-Way Handshake:**
   - The client sends a SYN packet to the server.
   - The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet.
   - The client sends an ACK packet, completing the handshake.

This handshake ensures a reliable connection before any data transfer.

## 3. **Firewall**

Firewalls on both the client and server sides inspect the incoming and outgoing packets to ensure they meet security rules. These firewalls can block suspicious or unauthorized requests.

---

## 4. **HTTPS/SSL**

Since the URL starts with `https`, an encrypted connection using SSL/TLS is established. This involves:

1. **Certificate Verification:**
   - The browser checks the server’s SSL certificate to ensure it’s valid and issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

2. **Key Exchange:**
   - The client and server use a secure method (like Diffie-Hellman) to exchange encryption keys.

3. **Session Encryption:**
   - All subsequent communication between the client and server is encrypted to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

---

## 5. **Load Balancer**

The request may first reach a load balancer, which distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers. This ensures high availability and scalability. The load balancer might:

- Route traffic based on geographic location.
- Check server health and direct traffic only to healthy servers.
- Terminate SSL/TLS connections to reduce the load on backend servers.

---

## 6. **Web Server**

The load balancer forwards the request to a web server, such as Nginx or Apache. The web server:

1. Parses the request headers.
2. Determines the type of content requested (static files like images or dynamic content).
3. Either serves static content directly or forwards the request to an application server for dynamic content.

---

## 7. **Application Server**

For dynamic requests, the web server interacts with an application server (e.g., Node.js, Django, or Flask). The application server:

1. Processes the request logic.
2. Runs backend code to generate a response.
3. Often queries a database to fetch or update data.

---

## 8. **Database**

The application server interacts with a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB) to retrieve or store data. This involves:

- Executing SQL queries or NoSQL commands.
- Ensuring data consistency and integrity.
- Returning the requested data to the application server.

---

## 9. **Response to the Browser**

The application server sends the generated response (e.g., an HTML page) back to the web server, which forwards it to the load balancer. The load balancer sends the response to your browser, completing the request-response cycle.

The browser:

1. Parses the HTML.
2. Makes additional requests for resources (CSS, JavaScript, images).
3. Renders the page for the user.

## Conclusion

This sequence of events showcases the complexity of a seemingly simple action. Each step involves multiple technologies and systems working together to deliver a seamless user experience. Mastering these concepts can set you apart in technical interviews and help you build robust software systems.
